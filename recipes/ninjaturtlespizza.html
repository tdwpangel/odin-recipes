            <h2>A Tasty Pepperoni Pizza Recipe Inspired By The Ninja Turtles TV Show</h2> 
    <br>
    <p>The pizza in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Tv show has always looked unbelievably tasty and the way the cheese stretches when they take bites out of it
        looked unreal as a child. This recipe is an attempt on that same pizza. If you are lactose intolerant please don't attempt to make this as this will most likely 
        use alot of cheese.
    </p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>16 ounces pizza dough, store-bought or homemade </li>
            <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce </li>
            <li>18 to 20 slices pepperoni</li>
            <li>12 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fresh oregano</li>
            <li>Flour for rolling and shaping dough</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 500Â°F. If you are using a pizza stone, preheat it in the oven for at least 20 minutes so it is nice and hot as well.</li>
            <li>Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface. If it's hard to roll, let it rest for 5 minutes so it can come to room temperature. For a large pizza, I like to roll my dough into about a 14-inch diameter circle.</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough to a lightly dusted pizza peel. Alternatively, fit it into a large cast-iron.
                Add sauce in a light layer all over the pizza, leaving about 1/4-inch crust around the edges. Chop half of the pepperoni and sprinkle it over the sauce. Top the pizza with grated cheese and the rest of the pepperoni. Season with black pepper.</li>
            <li>If you're using a pizza stone, carefully slide pizza into the center of the preheated pizza stone. Cook for 6 minutes, then rotate the pizza halfway so it cooks evenly. Cook for another 6-8 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and charred in spots.</li>
            <li>Use pizza peel to slide pizza out onto a cutting board. Let the pizza rest for a minute and slice into pieces. Season with fresh oregano (optional). Serve while warm with a side salad.</li>
        </ol>
